motion (3.2.3-2.1v6) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Non-maintainer upload to fix pending l10n issues.
  * Debconf translations:
    - Spanish. Closes: #404800
    - Japanese. Closes: #413003

  [ Yao-Tsung Wang ]
  * Add IPv6 support to http interface and webcam interface.
    - It will provide capability to accept IPv6 connection for MJPEG
      streaming out.
    - Note: I did not add IPv6 support to the url source of motion,
      since it will reduce the capability to connect to IPv4 only MJPEG
      streaming source.
